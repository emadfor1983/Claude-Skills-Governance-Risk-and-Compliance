## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are installable knowledge packages that extend Claude's capabilities for specific domains. A skill is a `.skill` file — a bundled archive containing a `SKILL.md` instruction file and optional reference materials — that you upload to Claude once and use across all your conversations.

Once installed, a skill activates **automatically** when your conversation touches its topic area. You don't need to invoke it by name or use special commands. Claude simply becomes a deeper expert in that domain for the duration of your session.

**Skills are ideal when you need:**
- Consistent, expert-level responses on a specialized topic
- Outputs formatted to professional or regulatory standards (e.g., audit-ready control narratives, policy templates with the right clauses)
- Domain knowledge that goes beyond general LLM training — such as knowing which specific NIST 800-53 controls apply to a given scenario, or which GDPR articles govern international data transfers

**How skills work under the hood:** Each `.skill` file contains a primary `SKILL.md` that is loaded into Claude's context when the skill triggers, plus reference files that are loaded on demand for deeper sub-topics. This "progressive disclosure" pattern keeps context usage efficient while making comprehensive knowledge available when needed.

## Who Is This For?

These skills are designed for professionals who work on information security, privacy, and regulatory compliance — whether at organizations seeking certification, development teams building compliant systems, or advisors supporting clients.

**Security & Compliance Teams** use these skills to accelerate gap assessments, generate first-draft policies, map controls, and prepare evidence packages — compressing weeks of reference work into minutes.

**Software Developers & Engineers** use them to understand what controls their systems must implement, audit code and architecture for compliance issues, and get actionable technical guidance tied to specific regulatory requirements.

**Legal, Privacy & GRC Professionals** use them to draft regulatory documents (DPAs, BAAs, privacy notices), answer client questions with precise regulatory citations, and stay current on framework requirements.

**Healthcare Organizations** use the HIPAA skill to assess systems, generate required notices and agreements, and train staff on obligations — without needing a compliance consultant for every question.

**Cloud Service Providers** pursuing federal government contracts use the FedRAMP skill to navigate the ATO process, write SSP narratives, manage POA&Ms, and prepare for 3PAO assessments.

**Startups and SMBs** use these skills to understand what a given framework requires of them, scope their compliance programs, and get expert-quality output without a large in-house team.

## Skill Evaluation

These skills were benchmarked using the [Claude Skill Creator](https://claude.ai) eval framework. **18 realistic test cases** were run across all 9 skills — 2 per framework — covering gap analysis, policy drafting, control narratives, code audits, breach response, CRMP drafting, and AI system impact assessments. Each test case was evaluated against 4–5 objectively verifiable assertions by independent grader agents comparing skill-assisted vs. baseline Claude responses.

| Configuration | Pass Rate |
|---------------|-----------|
| **With GRC Skills installed** | **94% ± 10%** |
| Without skills (baseline Claude) | 72% ± 28% |
| **Delta** | **+22 points** |

### Per-Skill Results (with skills)

| Skill | Test Cases | Pass Rate | What Was Tested |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| ISO 27001 | 2 | 100% | Stage 2 gap analysis; Access Control Policy drafting |
| SOC 2 | 2 | 100% | First-time audit guidance; CC6.3 control documentation |
| FedRAMP | 2 | 88% | AC-2 SSP narrative; Impact level & LI-SaaS guidance |
| GDPR | 2 | 100% | API endpoint audit with article citations; DPA drafting |
| HIPAA | 2 | 100% | Technical safeguards (45 CFR 164.312); Breach notification |
| NIST CSF | 2 | 78% | CSF 2.0 OT/IT gap assessment; Target profile for healthcare |
| PCI DSS | 2 | 90% | Stripe.js SAQ/CDE scope; v4.0.1 new requirements |
| TSA Cybersecurity | 2 | 100% | Pipeline CRMP obligations; Incident Reporting section |
| ISO 42001 | 2 | 90% | AI user gap assessment; AISIA for resume screening |

The skills add the most measurable value on highly framework-specific tasks: producing correct Annex A control IDs for ISO 27001, mapping gaps to CC criteria for SOC 2, generating formal third-person SSP prose with enhancement references for FedRAMP, applying article-level citations for GDPR, distinguishing Required vs. Addressable HIPAA specifications, using CSF 2.0 subcategory IDs for NIST, correctly identifying SAQ types for PCI, referencing specific TSA Security Directives and CISA contact details, and classifying AI system impact levels with AISIA methodology for ISO 42001.

> *"The skills approach is a good entry point — getting Claude to reason about specific frameworks is exactly the right instinct. The gap I kept hitting was that Claude could describe the compliance picture but couldn't act on it... this is a great start."*

## Support & Contributing

### Reporting Issues

If you find an error, outdated regulatory reference, or missing coverage in any skill, please [open a GitHub issue](../../issues) and include:
- The skill name (e.g., ISO 27001, FedRAMP)
- A description of the issue or incorrect guidance
- The correct information with a source reference if possible (e.g., regulatory text, official guidance document)

### Requesting New Skills

Have a compliance framework not covered here? Open a GitHub issue with the tag `skill-request` and describe the framework, your use case, and the audience it would serve. Community suggestions are welcome for frameworks such as NIST CSF, PCI DSS, CCPA, SOX, CMMC, and others.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. To contribute:

1. **Fork** this repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. **For skill improvements** — edit the relevant skill's `SKILL.md` or reference files. Follow the existing structure: YAML frontmatter, a routing/trigger section, and modular reference files.
3. **For new skills** — use the [Claude Skill Creator](https://claude.ai) to build your skill using the same progressive disclosure pattern (a lean `SKILL.md` + reference files loaded on demand).
4. **Cite your sources** — all regulatory content must be traceable to official sources (ISO standards, NIST publications, official regulatory text, agency guidance documents).
5. Submit a **Pull Request** with a clear description of what changed and why.

### Guidelines

- Keep `SKILL.md` focused and under ~500 lines. Offload detailed reference content to separate files in a `references/` folder.
- All compliance assertions must cite the governing clause, article, or control ID.
- Skills should include a disclaimer that outputs are informational guidance, not legal advice.
- Avoid paraphrasing regulatory text in ways that alter its meaning. Where possible, use the authoritative language directly.

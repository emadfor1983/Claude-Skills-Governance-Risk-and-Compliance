## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are installable knowledge packages that extend Claude's capabilities for specific domains. A skill is a `.skill` file — a bundled archive containing a `SKILL.md` instruction file and optional reference materials — that you upload to Claude once and use across all your conversations.

Once installed, a skill activates **automatically** when your conversation touches its topic area. You don't need to invoke it by name or use special commands. Claude simply becomes a deeper expert in that domain for the duration of your session.

**Skills are ideal when you need:**
- Consistent, expert-level responses on a specialized topic
- Outputs formatted to professional or regulatory standards (e.g., audit-ready control narratives, policy templates with the right clauses)
- Domain knowledge that goes beyond general LLM training — such as knowing which specific NIST 800-53 controls apply to a given scenario, or which GDPR articles govern international data transfers

**How skills work under the hood:** Each `.skill` file contains a primary `SKILL.md` that is loaded into Claude's context when the skill triggers, plus reference files that are loaded on demand for deeper sub-topics. This "progressive disclosure" pattern keeps context usage efficient while making comprehensive knowledge available when needed.

## Who Is This For?

These skills are designed for professionals who work on information security, privacy, and regulatory compliance — whether at organizations seeking certification, development teams building compliant systems, or advisors supporting clients.

**Security & Compliance Teams** use these skills to accelerate gap assessments, generate first-draft policies, map controls, and prepare evidence packages — compressing weeks of reference work into minutes.

**Software Developers & Engineers** use them to understand what controls their systems must implement, audit code and architecture for compliance issues, and get actionable technical guidance tied to specific regulatory requirements.

**Legal, Privacy & GRC Professionals** use them to draft regulatory documents (DPAs, BAAs, privacy notices), answer client questions with precise regulatory citations, and stay current on framework requirements.

**Healthcare Organizations** use the HIPAA skill to assess systems, generate required notices and agreements, and train staff on obligations — without needing a compliance consultant for every question.

**Cloud Service Providers** pursuing federal government contracts use the FedRAMP skill to navigate the ATO process, write SSP narratives, manage POA&Ms, and prepare for 3PAO assessments.

**Startups and SMBs** use these skills to understand what a given framework requires of them, scope their compliance programs, and get expert-quality output without a large in-house team.

The GDPR skill turns Claude into an expert GDPR compliance assistant that bridges technical and legal perspectives. It covers the full **EU GDPR** regulation with notes on **UK GDPR (DPA 2018)** where the rules differ, and adapts its tone automatically — technical for developers, legally precise for compliance and privacy professionals.

2. Open Claude and navigate to **Customize → Skills**.
3. Click **Upload Skill** and select the `.skill` file.
4. The skill is now active. Start a new conversation and ask your compliance question — Claude will automatically apply the skill.

> **Tip:** You can install multiple skills at once. If you work across several frameworks (e.g., both ISO 27001 and SOC 2), install all of them — Claude will activate whichever is most relevant to each question.

## Install via Claude Code Marketplace

If you use Claude Code — the AI-powered CLI for developers — these skills are also available as installable Claude Code plugins through a hosted marketplace. This is the recommended installation path for developers and teams, as it supports version-pinning, automatic updates, and team-wide distribution without any manual file handling.

Add the marketplace and install the skills you need directly from the terminal:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add Sushegaad/Claude-Skills-Governance-Risk-and-Compliance
/plugin install iso27001@grc-skills soc2@grc-skills fedramp@grc-skills gdpr-compliance@grc-skills hipaa-compliance@grc-skills
```

Teams can pre-wire the marketplace in `.claude/settings.json` so every developer gets the skills automatically when they open the project — no manual install required.

## Skill Evaluation

These skills were benchmarked using the [Claude Skill Creator](https://claude.ai) eval framework. 10 realistic test cases were run across all 5 skills — 2 per framework — covering gap analysis, policy drafting, control narratives, code audits, and document generation. Each test case was evaluated against 7 objectively verifiable assertions by independent grader agents.

| Configuration | Pass Rate |
|---------------|-----------|
| **With GRC Skills installed** | **99% ± 4%** |
| Without skills (baseline Claude) | 93% ± 7% |
| **Delta** | **+6 points** |

The skills add the most measurable value on framework-specific tasks: producing correct Annex A control breakdowns for ISO 27001, mapping gaps to CC9 for SOC 2 vendor risk, generating proper formal third-person SSP prose for FedRAMP, handling special category health data correctly under GDPR Art. 9, and consistently including required HIPAA legal disclaimers.

## Support & Contributing

### Reporting Issues

If you find an error, outdated regulatory reference, or missing coverage in any skill, please [open a GitHub issue](../../issues) and include:
- The skill name (e.g., ISO 27001, FedRAMP)
- A description of the issue or incorrect guidance
- The correct information with a source reference if possible (e.g., regulatory text, official guidance document)

### Requesting New Skills

Have a compliance framework not covered here? Open a GitHub issue with the tag `skill-request` and describe the framework, your use case, and the audience it would serve. Community suggestions are welcome for frameworks such as NIST CSF, PCI DSS, CCPA, SOX, CMMC, and others.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. To contribute:

1. **Fork** this repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. **For skill improvements** — edit the relevant skill's `SKILL.md` or reference files. Follow the existing structure: YAML frontmatter, a routing/trigger section, and modular reference files.
3. **For new skills** — use the [Claude Skill Creator](https://claude.ai) to build your skill using the same progressive disclosure pattern (a lean `SKILL.md` + reference files loaded on demand).
4. **Cite your sources** — all regulatory content must be traceable to official sources (ISO standards, NIST publications, official regulatory text, agency guidance documents).
5. Submit a **Pull Request** with a clear description of what changed and why.

### Guidelines

- Keep `SKILL.md` focused and under ~500 lines. Offload detailed reference content to separate files in a `references/` folder.
- All compliance assertions must cite the governing clause, article, or control ID.
- Skills should include a disclaimer that outputs are informational guidance, not legal advice.
- Avoid paraphrasing regulatory text in ways that alter its meaning. Where possible, use the authoritative language directly.

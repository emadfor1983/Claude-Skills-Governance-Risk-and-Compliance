## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are installable knowledge packages that extend Claude's capabilities for specific domains. A skill is a `.skill` file — a bundled archive containing a `SKILL.md` instruction file and optional reference materials — that you upload to Claude once and use across all your conversations.

Once installed, a skill activates **automatically** when your conversation touches its topic area. You don't need to invoke it by name or use special commands. Claude simply becomes a deeper expert in that domain for the duration of your session.

**Skills are ideal when you need:**
- Consistent, expert-level responses on a specialized topic
- Outputs formatted to professional or regulatory standards (e.g., audit-ready control narratives, policy templates with the right clauses)
- Domain knowledge that goes beyond general LLM training — such as knowing which specific NIST 800-53 controls apply to a given scenario, or which GDPR articles govern international data transfers

**How skills work under the hood:** Each `.skill` file contains a primary `SKILL.md` that is loaded into Claude's context when the skill triggers, plus reference files that are loaded on demand for deeper sub-topics. This "progressive disclosure" pattern keeps context usage efficient while making comprehensive knowledge available when needed.

## Who Is This For?

These skills are designed for professionals who work on information security, privacy, and regulatory compliance — whether at organizations seeking certification, development teams building compliant systems, or advisors supporting clients.

**Security & Compliance Teams** use these skills to accelerate gap assessments, generate first-draft policies, map controls, and prepare evidence packages — compressing weeks of reference work into minutes.

**Software Developers & Engineers** use them to understand what controls their systems must implement, audit code and architecture for compliance issues, and get actionable technical guidance tied to specific regulatory requirements.

**Legal, Privacy & GRC Professionals** use them to draft regulatory documents (DPAs, BAAs, privacy notices), answer client questions with precise regulatory citations, and stay current on framework requirements.

**Healthcare Organizations** use the HIPAA skill to assess systems, generate required notices and agreements, and train staff on obligations — without needing a compliance consultant for every question.

**Cloud Service Providers** pursuing federal government contracts use the FedRAMP skill to navigate the ATO process, write SSP narratives, manage POA&Ms, and prepare for 3PAO assessments.

**Startups and SMBs** use these skills to understand what a given framework requires of them, scope their compliance programs, and get expert-quality output without a large in-house team.

### 14. 🤖 NIST AI Risk Management Framework

**File:** `NIST AI RMF - Claude Skill/nist-ai-rmf.skill`

The NIST AI RMF skill turns Claude into an expert advisor on the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)**, published January 2023 as NIST AI 100-1. It covers all four core functions — GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, and MANAGE — with their 19 categories and subcategories, the AI RMF Playbook's suggested actions, and deep guidance on evaluating AI systems for trustworthiness.

**What it does:**
- Builds **AI organizational profiles** — Current Profile (where you are) and Target Profile (where you want to be) across all 19 categories with gap scoring and a prioritised remediation roadmap
- Conducts **GOVERN gap assessments** across all 6 categories (GV-1 to GV-6) — AI risk policies, accountability structures, roles, cross-functional teams, risk tolerance, and regulatory alignment
- Guides **MAP context-setting** for any AI system — intended use documentation, affected stakeholder mapping, risk/benefit analysis, and likelihood/impact characterization
- Specifies **MEASURE 2.x evaluation actions** before deployment — bias/fairness testing (demographic parity, equalized odds, disparate impact), explainability (SHAP, LIME, counterfactuals), adversarial robustness, privacy assessment, and human oversight validation
- Builds **AI risk registers** with per-risk AI RMF category citations (e.g., MAP 5.2, MEASURE 2.2, MANAGE 2.3), trustworthiness property at risk, treatment options, and owners
- Provides **MANAGE incident response** guidance — model failure triggers, containment procedures, stakeholder notification thresholds, and lessons-learned cycles
- **Maps AI RMF to ISO 42001, EU AI Act, and NIST CSF** — showing which AI RMF categories satisfy Art. 9 (EU AI Act risk management system), equivalent ISO 42001 clauses, and how AI RMF extends NIST CSF beyond cybersecurity into societal and ethical AI risk

**Trigger phrases:** `NIST AI RMF`, `AI RMF`, `NIST AI 100-1`, `AI Risk Management Framework`, `GOVERN function`, `MAP function`, `MEASURE function`, `MANAGE function`, `AI RMF Playbook`, `AI risk profile`, `AI trustworthiness`, `AI bias assessment`, `AI explainability`, `MEASURE 2.2`, `AI risk register`, `AI organizational profile`, `responsible AI framework`, `AI governance framework`, `AI incident response`, `AI RMF gap assessment`

### 15. 🏦 SWIFT Customer Security Programme (CSP)

**File:** `SWIFT CSP - Claude Skill/swift-csp.skill`

The SWIFT CSP skill turns Claude into an expert advisor on the **SWIFT Customer Security Controls Framework (CSCF) v2025** — the mandatory cybersecurity programme for all SWIFT network participants. It covers all 31 controls (23 mandatory + 8 advisory), all five architecture types (A1/A2/A3/A4/B), the KYC-SA annual attestation process, and complete cross-framework mappings to ISO 27001:2022, PCI DSS v4.0.1, and NIST CSF 2.0.

**What it does:**
- Determines the correct **SWIFT architecture type** (A1/A2/A3/A4/B) from a description of the organisation's SWIFT connectivity and produces the full mandatory/advisory control applicability matrix
- Conducts structured **CSCF v2025 gap assessments** with 🔴/🟡/🟢 status per control, evidence requirements, and prioritised remediation roadmaps
- Provides **deep-dive implementation guidance** for all 23 mandatory controls — purpose, requirements, step-by-step implementation, and audit evidence artifacts
- Guides the complete **KYC-SA attestation process** — evidence preparation per control, independent assessor qualification criteria, portal submission steps, and post-submission counterparty visibility
- Advises on the **CSCF v2024 → v2025 changes**: critical patch SLA tightened from 7 to 3 days, hardware MFA token requirement explicitly mandated, log retention clarified (1 year online, 3 years total)
- Provides **SWIFT-specific incident response** guidance — 24-hour initial notification to security@swift.com, 30-day full report, evidence preservation, and IRP content requirements for Control 7.1
- Explains **Type B (service bureau) responsibilities** — the split between bureau and customer obligations, and how to verify your bureau's KYC-SA attestation
- **Maps CSCF controls to ISO 27001:2022, PCI DSS v4.0.1, and NIST CSF 2.0** — identifying both synergies and SWIFT-specific additions not covered by existing certifications

**Trigger phrases:** `SWIFT CSP`, `CSCF`, `KYC-SA`, `SWIFT security attestation`, `Alliance Access`, `SWIFT operator MFA`, `SWIFT secure zone`, `SWIFT secure flow zone`, `CSCF v2025`, `Control 4.2 SWIFT`, `Control 6.4 SWIFT`, `Control 7.1 SWIFT`, `SWIFT architecture type A1`, `SWIFT service bureau`, `Type B SWIFT`, `SWIFT incident response`, `SWIFT gap assessment`, `SWIFT mandatory controls`, `SWIFT hardware token`, `SWIFT log retention`
